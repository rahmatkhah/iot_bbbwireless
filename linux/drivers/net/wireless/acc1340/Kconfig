	help
	  Enable support for the ACC1340 connected via an SDIO bus.
	  By default this driver only supports the Sagrad SG901-1091/1098 EVK
	  and similar designs that utilize a hardware reset circuit. To
	  support different ACC1340 SDIO designs you will need to override
	  the default platform data by calling cw1200_sdio_set_platform_data()
	  in your board setup file.

config ACC1340_WLAN_SPI
	tristate "Support SPI platforms"
	depends on ACC1340 && SPI
	help
	  Enables support for the ACC1340 connected via a SPI bus.  You will
	  need to add appropriate platform data glue in your board setup
	  file.
